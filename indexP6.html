			<h3>Why do you want to design?</h3>
				<p>The creativity. There’s something about creating something from scratch, an image or an art that wasn’t even there, didn’t exist and you made it a happen. Now after it’s finished, it’s part of the world. Whether you publish it, or you left it sitting there on your computer or sketchbook.

			<h3>What do you see yourself doing after you finished this program?</h3>

			<p>So far for now, the idea is to start working for a company or at a design place, in what part of design, I have no idea yet. Gain enough experience then go freelance. Or I could do both at the same time. But anything can change, since there’s a while to go before I finish this program, I might decide to do something else. We will see.</p>

			<h3>What is difficult or frustrating for you within design and how do you work to push past that?</h3>

			<p>The difficult or frustrating part for me within design is the design process, putting the idea I have together. Questions starts arising, like where to start, how do I do this or that, how do I get this to work, etc. Then once I made enough research and found what I wanted; it’s starts coming down together. Then then final result makes it all worthwhile.</p>

			<h3>Can design change the world?</h3>
			
			<p>In big way yes. Everything existing in this world starts with a design; the phone you are using, the tv at your house, the shoes and the clothes you are wearing, the toothpaste you are using etc. Design is all around us. Just like we see it in those futuristic style of movies, where everything is voice activated or controlled by technology, all of this came from some sort of design.</p>

			<h3>What excites you about design?</h3>
			
			<p>The final product. There’s something about seeing what you have been struggling with for days or weeks, seeing it when it’s finished makes it all satisfying. Also, the other new things you’ve learned along the way, you get to use them in other projects.</p>

			<h3>What worries you about design?</h3>
			
			<p>What worries me most about design is the ones being used to do harms or design being used more to do wrong then using it to do good in the world.</p>

			<h3>What is a website?</h3>
			
			<p>A website is a collection of pages on the World Wide Web, which contains lots and specific information provided by one or a a number of people and that can be traces back to a URL, a Uniform Resources Locator. Amazon is an example of a website.</p>
